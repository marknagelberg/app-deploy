# App Deploy

This is a very simple Flask application (essentially the hello world example
that can be found on the [Flask website](http://flask.pocoo.org/), used for the purpose of learning
workflow and best practices for deploying and maintaining a production web
application.

The corresponding series of blog posts showing the process of deploying and
maintaining this application can be found [here](http://www.marknagelberg.com/workflow-to-deploy-and-maintain-a-web-app/). To follow along with the
blog posts, clone this repository and each post will describe the commit to
checkout to see the relevant state of the repository for that lesson.
